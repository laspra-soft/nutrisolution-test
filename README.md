Hello! I really enjoyed working on this test.
There are definitely things to be improved, like for better request validation(I would use symfony/validator) 
and serialization using symfony/serializer or JMS serializer both for request and response.

I started with setting up tools like phpstan for static analysis, phpcs, adn deptrac for linting project structure

All in all it was fun to work with it, but I really have to stop myself here :)) Let me know your feedback!
